My primary interest lies in the field of computer vision, and I am eager to pursue research in this area. I have extensive experience in developing deep learning models for semantic segmentation of medical images, which involves the process of identifying and categorizing pixels within an image to accurately identify specific features. My proficiency in programming languages like Python and expertise in frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch have aided me in developing advanced models for this purpose.

Moreover, I have mentored both undergraduate and graduate students in their machine learning-based projects, providing them with the necessary guidance and resources to succeed. My PhD research focused on the automatic detection of malignancy in effusion cytology images, and I have published several research papers on this topic.

Furthermore, I have over six years of teaching experience across multiple engineering colleges. This experience has provided me with valuable skills in effectively communicating complex concepts to students, and has helped me in developing effective teaching methods that cater to diverse learning needs. All these skills and experiences combined have fueled my passion for advancing the field of computer vision and machine learning.
